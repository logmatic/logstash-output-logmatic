This project is an output plugin to send logs to Logmatic.io from Logstash >v1.5.0.

## How to install it?

The gem is published in the main repository.

```bash

```

Check the installation.
```bash

```

## How to use it?

Then you just need to configure the output as follow:

```
output {
    logmatic {
        key => "<your_api_key>"
    }
}

```
Donâ€™t forget to change `<your_api_key>` to your provided api key.
Once you are happy with your configuration you have to restart Logstash to take it account.
